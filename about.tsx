        I build resilient systems that scale—across borders, disciplines, and sectors. I’ve led AI innovation at financial institutions, restructured global manufacturing networks, and built trauma-informed humanitarian frameworks across 65+ countries.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My core is systems thinking with a human lens: strategy meets ethics, and execution meets empathy. Whether it’s P&L for 8 factories, data governance in sensitive environments, or policy-collaboration in mental health, I work where complexity and consequence meet.

        Turkish by birth, shaped by Tallinn, operating from The Hague—I work globally. Fluent in English, Turkish, and conversant in Nordic systems, I thrive in cross-border environments where the right solution needs more than just a playbook.
