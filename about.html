    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I’ve never been interested in surface clarity - only the kind that endures friction. My work lives at the intersection of strategy, communication, and systems architecture. Whether leading global transformation programs, bridging operations across borders, or co-designing interventions in fractured networks, I am drawn to the challenge of seeing what holds, what breaks, and what matters.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I was born in Istanbul and shaped by migration, contradiction, and movement - geographical, political, and structural. I’ve worked within governments, banks, international NGOs, and manufacturing corporations. I’ve spoken the languages of compliance, crisis, growth, and grief - and I’ve built fluency in how people and systems mirror each other.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I don’t just work on operations. I work on *why* something operates. I bring questions that seem philosophical but resolve into clean process. I don’t believe in wasting motion. I believe in beautiful mechanisms - the kind that serve people.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed italic text-gray-700">
      The way I see it: integrity is not just a moral stance. It’s structural intelligence.
